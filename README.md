The general idea is that you want the narrative or "story" of your thesis to be set out very clearly and strongly in the first chapter.  In our lab we use what I call the "hourglass model" which is described in these videos. It can also be called the "Telescope/Microscope" model.  Basically you start with a broad view of the world, from the perspective of the project you are undertaking, and address the following questions:

### The Telescope Stage: Narrowing in / Establishing Scope
1. Describe the world
2. What is wrong with it?
3. What should be done about it?
4. What are we going to do about it?
### The Microscope Stage: Zooming in
5. How are you going to do it?
6. What are the research questions?
7. How will you measure success?

Chapter 2 is then the literature review, which serves two functions:
1. Provide evidence that you have engaged with the relevant academic literature
2. Provide the background for a computer science generalist to understand your project.
